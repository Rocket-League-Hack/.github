## Comparisons with Other Mods

Unlike survival shooters like Warzone or Ring of Elysium where hacks focus on aimbot and ESP for enemies, Rocket League hacks are about **precision and control**. ESP overlays give you awareness of boost pads and ball direction, while aimbot-like tools focus only on ball accuracy. Compared to regular trainer mods, full hack menus bring total customization to matches.
